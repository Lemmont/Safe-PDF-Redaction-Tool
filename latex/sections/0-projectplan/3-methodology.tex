%how is the research conducted? Which subtasks can be distinguished? For example: extensive literature research, design and implementation of a program, design of an experiment.

An extensive review of the literature is needed to gather information about the PDF file extension; manipulation, readability, structure etc. Meanwhile, further research into the security concerns, redaction techniques and legality needs to be done to gain an even better understanding of the problem and the efforts made in the field. What follows is a hands on and practical approach where gained knowledge is put into action and experimentation. First, I have to create the right environment to conduct design, implementing and testing; gather the necessary tools, examples and code. A design of a safe PDF text redaction tool has to be created and implemented. This process must be executed incrementally, with design and testing proceeding simultaneously to ensure adherence to safety requirements.
