\label{sec:introduction}
% Describe here the part of the field in which this research takes place. It should be clear from this section how the research question, which will be described later, is positioned within computer science.

This research takes place in the field of text redaction tools. In this field there is a focus on developing and improving methods that enable the secure and efficient redaction of text in digital documents, in this case PDF. 

Text redaction tools are essential in various domains. These domains include legal, healthcare, government and corporate sectors where privacy and data protection are of paramount importance. Text redaction tools are used to safeguard sensitive information by hiding or obliterating portions of text, making it unreadable or unintelligible while preserving the structure of the document. No reference to the redacted text should be left in the document after redaction and no means of identification should be possible by its relation to the non-redacted text i.e. width and glyph shifts.   

Overall, this research deals with the intersection of information security, document processing and algorithmic techniques.
