\section{Research Question}
% describe the problem that will be worked on. This often takes the form of a reflection with regard to the “state-of-the-art” just described. As part of the research question, it is also described what the project will deliver: the product that will be delivered at the end, eg the results of a research, the source code of developed software, documentation.

Many security concerns within the PDF text redaction field exist and often confidentiality and privacy are compromised as a result of either human error or information left behind in the document. In my research i want to answer the following: \textit{How can we design and develop a PDF text redaction tool that effectively addresses security concerns, including the prevention of information leakage through glyph shifts and width equivalence classes, while preserving non-redacted text.} The project will deliver a PDF text redaction method based on relevant research and literature. After design, this redaction method will be tested based on test examples and relevant tools (link tools) that check the safety of redactions in a PDF document. Finally, the method will be integrated a simple GUI that makes is easily usable to use and test.
